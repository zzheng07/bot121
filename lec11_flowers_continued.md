#### Flower Structures
![flower_structure](/assets/flower_structure.png)

Pistil
+ A pistil is made of fused carpels.

#### Flower Symmetry
+ Radial
+ Bilateral

#### Ovary Position
+ Superior Ovary
  - E.g. Tomato
+ Semi-inferior Ovary
+ Inferior Ovary
  - Pomegranate

#### Note all flowers have all floral organs
+ Pistillate flowers have only the pistile, no male parts (no stamens)
+ Staminate flowers have only the stamens. no female parts (no carpels)

#### Monoecious VS. Dioecious
+ Monoecious - seperate staminate and pistillate flowers on the same plant but in different locations (Corn)
+ Dioecious - seperate staminate and pistillate flowers on different plants (Marijuanan)


+ Mature ovule becomes the seed.
+ Mature ovary becomes the fruit.
+ Seed (fertilized ovule) - Embryo, Endosperm (food supply), Seed Coat

#### Fruit Classification
+ Simple Fruit
  - E.g. Apricot
  - Develops from a single flower with one carpel or fused carpels

+ Aggregate fruit
  - E.g. Raspberry
  - Develops from a single flower with many separate carpels

+ Multiple fruit
  - E.g. Pineapple
  - Develops from many flowers with many carpels


Simple Fruit Types
+ Dehiscent - a dry fruit that breaks apart at maturity

Simple Fruit
+ Dry
  - Dehiscent
    * Legume (Pod)
    * Capsule
    * Silique
  - Indehiscent
    * Achene
    * Cayopsis (Grain)
    * Samara
    * Nut
+ Fleshy
  - Drupe
  - Berry
    * Pepo
    * Hesperidium
  - Pome


#### Seed Dispersal - Wind, Water, Animal

Some Plants are Parasites
+ Haustoria = Penerating roots of parasitic plants
