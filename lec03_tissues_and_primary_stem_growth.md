#### Tissue Overview

##### Meristems
+ Apical meristems
  - causes primary growth (lengthening of plant)
  - occurs at tips of shoots and roots
  - Produces new leaves and flowers

+ Lateral meristems
  - Causes secondary growth (widening of plant)
  - Occurs at the cambium
  - Produces bark on trees

##### 3 Main Tissues
1. Epidermal(stomata, trichomes)
+ The dermal tissue system is the outer covering of the plant.
+ Outermost Layer of cells
+ More than one cell type
+ Covered with a waxy cuticle layer to prevent water loss
+ Guard cells from stomata
+ Trichomes - hairs

2. Ground(Parenchyma, collenchyma, sclerenchyma[fibers and sclereids])
+ The ground tissue system carries out photosynthesis, stores photosynthetic products, and helps support the plant.
+ Called Cortex in Mauseth Book
+ Present in most organs of the plant
+ Simple tissues are made one type of cell
+ Complex tissues are made up of two or more cell types

3. Vascular(Xylem[tracheids and vessel elements], phloem[sieve and memebers and companion cells])
+ The vascular tissue system conducts water and solutes through out the plant.
