##### Levels of Organization in Life
- Atoms
- Molecules
- Cells
- Tissues
- Organs
- Organisms
- Ecosystems

Plant Tissues

+ Shoot apical meristem

##### Three Tissue Systems
- Surface (Dermal)
- Vascular Tissues
- Ground Tissues

#### The Cell Theory
+ A Cell is the smallest unit of organism that exhibits all the characteristics of life.
+ All organisms are composed of cells.
+ Cells are the structural and functional component of living things
+ All cells arise from preexisting cells

#### Cells
Two types of cells
+ Prokaryotic - Archaebacteria, Eubacteria
+ Eukaryotic - Fungi, Protista, Plants, Animals
  - Plasma membrane
  - Nucleus
  - Cytoplasmic Organelles (Organelles: subcelluar membrane bound compartment)

The most striking difference, the one that gives them their name, is **the presence of a true membrane-bounded nucleus in eukaryotic cells**. In addition, eukaryotic cells have many organelles that allow them to be more diverse and complex, both morphologically and physiologically.

##### Cell wall
+ Made mostly of cellulose
+ Function: Support and protection
+ All plants cells have a flexible primary cell wall
+ Some cells have a rigid secondary cell wall imbedded with lignin

##### Plasma Membrane
A selective premeable barries that regulares the movement of substance in and out of the cell.

##### Nucleus
+ Bounded by a double membrane - nuclear membrane.
+ Control center of the cell with the instructions (recorded in the nucleotide sequenece of DNA) for making many different enzymes and other proteins.

##### Chloroplast
+ Specilized plastid where photosynthesis occur
+ Other plastids may be colorless (leucoplasts) or brightly pigmented yellow, organe, or red(chromoplasts)

##### Vacuole
+ Membrane enclosed fluid filled space
+ Can occupy a large volume of the cell (up to 90% in a mature cell)
+ Functions:
  1. Helps maintain cell pressure
  2. Storage and breakdown of celluar waste products
  3. Location of water soluble dyes called anthocyanins (purple and red color)
