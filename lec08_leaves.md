### Lecture 8: Leaves

> Reading
1\. Leaves chapter in Mauseth pages 143-154
2\. Trees Amount Us: Introduction

#### External Stem Structures
![External Stem Structures](/assets/external_stem_structures.png)

+ Deciduous plant
+ Shoot apical meristem is buried inside the terminal (axillar) bud.
+ Leaf Scars have vascular bundle scars. The scale can fall off and leaves a scale scar

#### The Functions of Leaves
+ Photosynthesis
  - Feeding organ of the plants. CO2 comes in from the atmosphere. Chlorophyll receive particles of lite that energized electrons to polymerize carbon.
+ Regulate Water loss - transpiration
   - Transpiration - loss of water (flowing out of a stomata hole)
+ Many Specilized Functions
  + Storage - Succulent leaves store water
  + Protection - Can be pointy)
  + Attraction - Colorfull, attracts pollinators)
  + Nutrition - From the environment (from bodies)
  + Propagation - Some plants will make new plantets in the margin of their leaves
  + Climbing - Tendrils can be leaves or stems dependings where they come from. They get shorter and shorter for grip.


Succulent leaves store water

Tenderils aid climbing

Insects trapping leaves

Bracts are leaves associated with flowers. They help attract pollinators

Spines provide protection

#### Internal Leaf Anatomy
![leaf_anatomy](/assets/leaf_anatomy.png)
All 3 tissue types are there.
+ Epidermis
  - Epidermis cells are waxy and make up the cuticle (The cuticle can be suberin or other types of wax)
  - Lower epidermis has the guard cells that makes up the stomata
+ Vasculatur
  - Vascular bundles are veins in it. This is xylem and phloem with fibers.
+ Ground Tissues
  - Photosynthetic parenchyma cells - mesophyll (the middle of the leaf)
  - Some mesophyll is spongy.

#### Morphology of a Leaf
+ Blade - expanded portion of the leaf
+ Petiole - leaf stalk
  - Sessile -leaves without a petiole
+ Stipule
  - appendage at the base of the petiole
  - Could be Photosynthetic
  - Sheading water away from the axillary bud
  - Or they can turn intp spine

#### Leaf Attachment (Phyllotaxy)
+ Alternate
+ Opposite
+ Whorled

#### Leaf Form (Shape)
**An axillary bud defines a leaf**
+ Where the split happens is no axillary bud. That's the difference between stem and leaves.
+ Stem won't terminate in a leaflet.

**Simple**
+ The leaf blades are not divided into seperate parts (May be deeply lobed)
+ Can be very diverse
  - Palmate lobes - like fingers on a hand.
  - Pinnate lobes - lobes coming off the edge.

![Compounded Leaves](/assets/compounded_leaves.png)

**Pinnately Compounded**
+ Leaflets arise from either side of the rachis
+ Leaflets come off the edge center axis of leaf

**Bipinnately Compounded**
+ Leaflets diverge from petiole (no rachis)
+ Like pinnately compounded but they divide again.

**Palmately Compounded**
+ Leaflets come off the tip of the petiole like fingers on the palm of a hand
+ Leaflets diverge from the petiole tip (No rachis)

**Rachis**
+ An extension of the petiole

**Compounded Leaves**
+ Leaf blades are divided into leaflets

**Acron**
+ Not noticeable as leaves
+ A branch makes a ton of leaves and finishes off with a flower. The flower gets pollinated and turns into the acron fruit. The spiralling is specialized modified leaves.

#### Leaf Lobing

#### Leaf Venation

#### Identification can be based of keys
+ Poison hemlock - stem with purple spots
+ Carrots and fennel - stem without spots
